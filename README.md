# PersonalDashboard

## Description

This is a simple project that displays my personalized dashboard when I open a new tab, which can be accomplished by adding it as a chrome extension.
This project was part of [a course from Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/playlist/pLN39CN) where I learned more deeply about Asynchronous JavaScript
and working with APIs.

Users should be able to:

- Dynamically get a bg image, Bitcoin's current price in usd, their local time, the weather for their location, a philosophy quote, and the author of the image.
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
